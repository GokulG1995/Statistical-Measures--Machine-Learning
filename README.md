tatistical measures play a crucial role in understanding and evaluating machine learning models. They help quantify relationships between variables, assess model performance, and ensure data quality. Here are some key statistical measures used in machine learning:

Mean: The average of a set of values, providing a central tendency of the data. It helps in understanding the general trend.

Median: The middle value in a sorted data set, less affected by outliers than the mean, useful when data is skewed.

Mode: The most frequent value in a dataset, commonly used in categorical data analysis.

Variance: Measures the spread of data points from the mean. A high variance indicates that data points are widely dispersed, whereas a low variance means they are clustered around the mean.

Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, indicating how much the values deviate from the mean. It's a measure of data dispersion.

Skewness: Indicates the asymmetry of data distribution. Positive skew means a longer right tail, while negative skew indicates a longer left tail.

Kurtosis: Measures the "tailedness" or the sharpness of the peak of the data distribution. High kurtosis indicates heavy tails and outliers.

Correlation: Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient is widely used, ranging from -1 (strong negative) to +1 (strong positive).

Confusion Matrix: A table used for classification problems, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives to evaluate model performance.

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Metrics used to evaluate classification models. Accuracy gives the overall correctness, while precision, recall, and F1-score provide more nuanced insights into performance.
